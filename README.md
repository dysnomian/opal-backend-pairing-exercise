## Opal Backend Pairing for Fun and Profit!


### Abstract

It's the year 3000. Mankind is long gone and only hyper-intelligent horses remain.
Being the social creatures that they are, they seek to create the worlds first
equine-centric social network. While especially artistic horses are busy
designing mobile and web clients on hoof-optimized keyboards, you and
your team are tasked with building a RESTful API that will power both.

### Objective

Using TDD, create a simple HTTP API that provides the following

1. A method for creating, editing, and deleting horses from the application.
2. The ability to "befriend" another horse and list your friendships
3. A way to create a new personal update for your feed, as well as list the updates from your friends
4. Allows "un-friending" of an existing horse-friend when their timeline posts become too obnoxious.

### Instructions

1. Ensure you have a functioning development environment with at least Ruby 2.2.0
2. Fork this repository to your personal account and clone locally
3. Run 'bundle install'
4. Commit any changes to your fork and open a pull-request against this repo

### Things to keep in mind

* Try to use TDD whenever possible
* Keep it simple
* Document your code if you have time to spare
